        <h2>Origins of MassKara Festival</h2>
        <p>The MassKara Festival, held annually every 4th Sunday of October in Bacolod, Philippines, is a vibrant celebration featuring highlights at various sites including the Bacolod Public Plaza, the Lacson Tourism Strip, and the Bacolod City Government Center. The term "MassKara" is a portmanteau created by the late artist Ely Santiago, combining "mass" (representing a multitude of people) with the Spanish word "cara" (meaning face), resulting in "MassKara" (signifying a multitude of faces). Additionally, it's a play on the Filipino word "maskara," meaning "mask" in Spanish, which is a central element of the festival, typically adorned with smiling faces. This association has led to Bacolod being affectionately known as the "City of Smiles." The MassKara Festival originated in 1980 during a time of tragedy when the MV Don Juan sank, resulting in loss of lives. To uplift spirits, Bacolod's local government initiated the festival as a celebration of resilience and unity, coinciding with the city's Charter Day. Over the years, the festival has grown into a major tourism attraction, showcasing the city's culture and creativity. The addition of the Electric MassKara further enhanced the festival's appeal, featuring illuminated floats and vibrant performances. Despite its somber beginnings, the festival has become a symbol of Bacolod's resilience and vitality, with the 2019 celebration marking its 40th anniversary, aptly named Ruby MassKara.<p>
