                <h3>Spanish Colonial Period</h3>
                <p>Bacolod's early history unfolds through the lens of its humble beginnings as the riverside settlement of Magsungay, later known as San Sebastián de Magsung̃ay. Established around the 18th century under the care of Saint Sebastian, the village transitioned into the town of Bacolod in 1755 after an attack by Datu Bantílan of Sulu prompted its relocation to the hilly area of Bacólod, now the barangay of Granada. Bernardino de los Santos assumed the role of the first gobernadorcillo. By 1802, Bacolod gained its first resident parish priest, fostering its growth as a town. In 1849, it became the capital of Negros Occidental, marking a pivotal moment in its political and religious history. Under Augustinian Recollect administration, Bacolod flourished, witnessing milestones such as the establishment of a compulsory primary public school system in 1863. Bacolod's ascent continued as it assumed the role of capital for Occidental Negros in 1889, solidifying its position as a pivotal hub in Negros' development.</p>

                <h3>Revolution and Republic of Negros</h3>
                <p>The uprising in Bacolod and surrounding areas during the late 19th century was fueled by the weakened morale of the local Spanish forces following defeats in Panay and Luzon, combined with psychological warfare tactics employed by Generals Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta. In 1897, a significant battle took place at Matab-ang River, and in 1898, the Negrense Revolutionary Army successfully captured the convent, now known as Palacio Episcopal, after armed conflict. The provisional junta established on November 7, 1898, under the leadership of Aniceto Lacson, briefly unified Occidental Negros and Oriental Negros under the cantonal government of the Negrense Revolucionarios, with Bacolod as the capital. However, in March 1899, American forces led by Colonel James G. Smith occupied Bacolod, effectively ending the brief period of independence under the Republic of Negros.</p>

                <h3>American Colonial Period</h3>
                <p>On April 30, 1901, the Cantonal Republic of Negros was incorporated into U.S. territory, once again separating Negros Island and restoring Bacolod as the capital of Occidental Negros. In 1902, Instituto Rizal, a public school, commenced operations, followed by the establishment of the Colegio de Nuestra Señora de la Consolación, the province's first private institution, in 1919. A significant milestone occurred in 1938 when the Municipality of Bacolod was granted city status through Commonwealth Act No. 326. Sponsored by Assemblyman Pedro C. Hernáez, the bill was passed on June 18, 1938, and Bacolod was formally inaugurated as a chartered city on October 19, 1938, with Alfredo Montelíbano, Sr. appointed as its first city mayor by Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon.</p>

                <h3>Japanese Occupation and Allied Liberation</h3>
                <p>During World War II, Bacolod fell under Japanese occupation on May 21, 1942, with Lieutenant General Kawano Takeshi commanding the forces. The homes of prominent figures, including Don Generoso Villanueva and Don Mariano Ramos, were seized to serve as military headquarters. Bacolod was liberated by joint Philippine and American forces on May 29, 1945, though reconstruction efforts were needed. Notably, upon the orders of Lt. General Takeshi, the homes of Villanueva and Ramos were spared from destruction. In March 1945, during the invasion of American and Philippine forces, Major General Rapp Brush occupied Villanueva's house for approximately five months. Bacolod became a strategic base for the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 7th Constabulary Regiment during and after the war.</p>

                <h3>Independent Philippines</h3>
                <p>Following the country's independence from the United States, Bacolod saw the reconstruction of its public markets and slaughterhouses under Mayor Vicente Remitió's administration from 1947 to 1949. However, a fire in 1948 destroyed a portion of the old city hall's records section, resulting in the loss of numerous invaluable city documents. Bacolod was later classified as a highly urbanized city on September 27, 1984. In 1985, a devastating fire nearly destroyed the historic Palacio Episcopal, though reconstruction efforts were completed in 1990. Over the years, Bacolod has garnered numerous accolades, including being named the "Best Place to Live in the Philippines" by MoneySense Magazine in 2008. It has also been recognized as a center of excellence for information technology and business process management operations by the Department of Science and Technology. Bacolod received the "Top Philippine Model City" award in 2017 and 2019 and was honored with the "2021 Most Business-Friendly Local Government Unit Award" by the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</p>
